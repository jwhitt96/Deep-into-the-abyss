intro: Koh Tao is located on the east side of the Surat Thani coastline with two neighbouring islands, Koh Phangan and Koh Samui.  It is officially a subdistrict of Koh Phangan in Surat Thani province, and the name, in English, means ‘Turtle Island’ as the island used to be inhabited by many turtles.  The island’s shape is also thought to resemble a turtle when viewed from Koh Phangan.
description: The island’s natural beauty both above and below the water, with its stunning coral reefs and abundant marine life in clear, warm water, bring thousands of visitors here each year making it an unforgettable destination for divers, adventurers and travellers alike. This, combined with the relaxed atmosphere and life style, has been attracting people here for over 35 years and is now a warm second home for many.  Koh Tao has developed in many ways, and with its thriving diving industry, is now one of the leading centres for dive education in the world.
