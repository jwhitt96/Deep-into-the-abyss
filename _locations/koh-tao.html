intro: Koh Tao is located on the east side of the Surat Thani coastline with two neighbouring islands, Koh Phangan and Koh Samui.  It is officially a subdistrict of Koh Phangan in Surat Thani province, and the name, in English, means ‘Turtle Island’ as the island used to be inhabited by many turtles.  The island’s shape is also thought to resemble a turtle when viewed from Koh Phangan. The island’s natural beauty both above and below the water, with its stunning coral reefs and abundant marine life in clear, warm water, bring thousands of visitors here each year making it an unforgettable destination for divers, adventurers and travellers alike. This, combined with the relaxed atmosphere and life style, has been attracting people here for over 35 years and is now a warm second home for many.  Koh Tao has developed in many ways, and with its thriving diving industry, is now one of the leading centres for dive education in the world.
description: I first arrived in Koh Tao on the 23rd of June. This would be my new home for the next few months as I began my journey towards becoming a professional scuba diver. I’d already done my open water/ advanced so began my time their on the rescue course. This was exhausting but gave me the confidence that no matter what situation presented itself underwater I was able to deal with it. I then started on doing my dive master which went on for just over 2 months. Being on a island such as Koh Tao was ideal to this kind of course as I could complete it quicker than I ever could back home and didn’t have be on the boat all the time doing stuff for my dive master course but could have ‘fun dives’ and enjoy everything that Thailand had to offer. Being embedded as part of the “Simple Life” dive team was such a great experience and the people who I worked with on the boat everyday became like family. If your ever think about doing your professional diving qualification Koh Tao (and Simple Life Divers specially) is a place that I’d recommend you do it. Even if you’re just passing through on your travels it’s a place I’d recommend stopping for few days as it has some of the best Thailand has to offer and pretty good night life on the evening to wind down after a hard days diving. It’s only a short boat trip from the two sister islands Koh Pha-ngan and Koh Samui. You can get their on either Seatran or Lomprayah ferries from the mainland at Champion or from Koh Samui where their is an airport you can fly into from either Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur. It usually costs about 600 THB which is about (20$) each way. If you have any questions drop me a message below I will always reply to any queries..
